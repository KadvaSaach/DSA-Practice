# Tree Traversal Algorithms

Here are some examples of tree traversal algorithms and their recommended use cases:

## If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:

Algorithm: Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:

Algorithm: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
(Note: Depth-First Search (DFS) might take a long time)

## If the tree is very wide:

Algorithm: Depth-First Search (DFS)
(Note: Breadth-First Search (BFS) would require too much memory)

## If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:

Algorithm: Depth-First Search (DFS)

## Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:

Algorithm: Depth-First Search (DFS)

## Finding the shortest path:

Algorithm: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
